' The TickUtils class is a GlobalMultiuse class, which means that you don't have to create
' an instance of it to use its methods and properties. Simply call them directly.
'
'
' <h2>About the TickUtils27 component</h2>
'
' The TickUtils27 component provides types and interfaces useful for working with financial
' market data. It also includes mechanisms for encoding market tick data into a compressed binary
' format for storage in files or databases.
'
' <h2>Market data encoding and decoding</h2>
'
' The functionality is provided by two interfaces,
' <code>TickDataEncoder</code> and <code>TickDataDecoder</code>,
' together with a pair of global factory methods that create instances of classes that
' implement these interfaces - these methods are
' <code>CreateTickEncoder</code> and <code>CreateTickDecoder</code>.
'
' The encoding used places strict limits on the time span covered by an encoder: this
' is because tick times are recorded as a number of milliseconds from the start of the
' encoding period, and these values are recorded as 16-bit unsigned integers: the maximum
' timespan is therefore 65535 millseconds. Once this limit has been reached, the encoded
' data must be retrieved from the encoder and written to storage, and a new encoder must
' then be created.  The expectation is that tick data recording programs will limit
' individual stored segments of encoded data to an interval such as 30 seconds or 1 minute,
' and that these segments will be stored in a variable length container such as a BLOB
' (Binary Large Object) column in a database row, or a suitably structured file.
'
' To summarise the use of this component:
'
' <h4>Encoding</h4>
'
' 1. At the start of each encoding interval (say at the start of each minute or each 30 seconds,
' but not longer than one minute), create a new encoder object by calling
' <code>CreateTickEncoder</code> global method.
'
' 2. As each tick arrives, encode it by calling the appropriate method of the encoder object,
' depending on the type of tick.
'
' 3. At the end of the encoding period, obtain from the encoder object the base price, the
' encoded data and the encoding format identifier, and write these to your data store along
' with the period start time and the ticksize. Then discard the existing encoder object,
' and return to step 1.
'
' <h4>Decoding</h4>
'
' 1. Retrieve from your data store the encoded data, and the corresponding period start time,
' base price, tick size and encoding format identifier.
'
' 2. Create a new decoder object using the <code>CreateTickDecoder</code> global method.
'
' 3. Extract the next tick from the decoder by calling its <code>getNextTick</code> method.
'
' 4. Process the tick as required by your program.
'
' 5. Repeat from step 3 until <code>getNextTick</code> indicates that there are no further
' ticks.
'
' <h2>Encoding format</h2>
'
' Details of the encoding scheme are provided here for completeness, and to enable developers
' to produce compatible software in other languages.
'
' No understanding of the encoding scheme is necessary to use this software.
'
' The encoding format identifier for this encoding scheme is this URN:
' <p>
'  urn:uid:b61df8aa-d8cc-47b1-af18-de725dee0ff5
' <p>
' Future enhancements to this encoding scheme, or different encoding schemes, will have
' different encoding format identifiers.
'
' An encoded data segment is a byte array, consisting of a series of variable-length records. Each
' record encodes a single tick.
' <p>
' A record consists of an initial byte, called the type byte, followed by zero or more fields
' containing the tick's attributes. The fields included in any particular record depend on the
' type of the tick encoded in the record. The following types of field are defined:
' <pre>
'      Timestamp field
'      Price field
'      Size field
'      Side/operation/position field
'      Marketmaker field
' </pre>
'
' Ask ticks, bid ticks, and trade ticks contain the following fields:
' <pre>
'      [timestamp] price size
' </pre>
'
' Close ticks, high ticks, low ticks and open ticks contain the following fields:
' <pre>
'      [timestamp] price
' </pre>
'
' Open interest and volume ticks contain the following fields:
' <pre>
'      [timestamp] size
' </pre>
'
' Market depth ticks contain the following fields:
' <pre>
'      [timestamp] side/operation/position price size marketmaker
' </pre>
'
' Market depth reset ticks contain the following fields:
' <pre>
'      [timestamp]
' </pre>
'
' <h3>Type byte format</h3>
'
' The type byte indicates the tick's type, and has some additional flags that are used to optimise
' the encoding. Its format is:
' <pre>
'      Bit 7       NegativeTicks       If set, indicates that the price for this tick is below
'                                      the segment's base price.
'
'      Bit 6       NoTimestamp         If set, indicates that this record contains no timestamp
'                                      field, meaning that the timestamp is the same as for the
'                                      previous record (or is the same as the start time for
'                                      the segment if this is the first record)
'
'      Bits 4-5    SizeTypeBits        Indicates how the size field for this record (if any) has
'                                      been encoded. The following values are used:
'
'                                      ByteSize (1)        encoded as an unsigned 8-bit value
'                                      UInt16Size (2)      encoded as an unsigned little-endian
'                                                          16-bit value
'                                      UInt32Size (3)        encoded as an unsigned little-endian
'                                                          32-bit value
'
'      Bits 0-3    TickTypeBits        The type of the tick encoded in this record. The following
'                                      values are used:
'
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeBid (0)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeAsk (1)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeClosePrice (2)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeHighPrice (3)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeLowPrice (4)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeMarketDepth (5)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeMarketDepthReset (6)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeTrade (7)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeVolume (8)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeOpenInterest (9)
'                                      TickTypes.TickTypeOpenPrice (10)
'
'                                      Other tick types may be added in future. Note that the maximum
'                                      value of 'Tick type' is 15, but there may be a need for more
'                                      tick types than this. Therefore the value 15 is reserved to
'                                      indicate that the tick type is encoded using an extension
'                                      mechanism. This mechanism is not currently defined.
' </pre>
'
' <h3>Timestamp field format</h3>
'
' The timestamp field is encoded as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit integer value representing the number of
' milliseconds between the start of the encoding period and the time of the tick.
'
' <h3>Price field format</h3>
'
' The base price for an encoded segment is the first price value encountered during encoding.
'
' The price field is stored as an integer value, being the absolute value of the difference between the tick price
' and the base price, divided by the minimum tick size (call this value numTicks). If numticks is negative, then
' NEGATIVE_TICKS in the type byte is set. The absolute value of numticks (|numTicks|) is then encoded as follows:
' <p>
' - if |numTicks| is less than 128, then it is stored in a single byte
' <p>
' - otherwise, |numTicks| is stored as a big-endian 16-bit value, with bit 15 set to 1.
' <p>
' Note that this encoding scheme enables the decoder to detect whether the value is stored in one byte or two by
' examining the first bit of the first byte.
' <p>
' Note also that this scheme limits |numticks| to a maximum of 32767. Therefore should there be more than 32767 ticks between the
' first price encountered and any subsequent price during an encoding period, the encoding will fail. Given the
' very short duration of an encoding period, and the fact that no securities currently have prices that are more than
' 32767 ticks, this has a near-zero probability of occurring.
'
' <h3>Size field format</h3>
'
' The size field is encoded as follows:
' <p>
' - if the value is an integer less than 256, it is stored as an unsigned 8-bit value and SIZE_TYPE_BITS is set to SizeTypes.ByteSize
' <p>
' - if the value is an integer less than 65536, it is stored as an unsigned little-endian 16-bit value and SIZE_TYPE_BITS is
' set to SizeTypes.UInt16Size
' <p>
' - if the value is an integer between &H80000000 and &H7FFFFFFF, it is stored as an unsigned little-endian 32-bit value
' and SIZE_TYPE_BITS is set to SizeTypes.UInt32Size
' <p>
' - otherwise SIZE_TYPE_BITS is set to SizeTypes.DecimalSize. The value is stored as a byte array containing the
' value's string representation.
'
' <h3>Side/operation/position field format</h3>
'
'  The Side/operation/position field is stored in a single byte with the following format:
' <pre>
'      Bits 0-4    PositionBits        The position in the Depth-of-Market (DOM) table that this tick relates to. This
'                                      allows for a maximum of 64 levels in the DOM table.
'
'      Bits 5-6    OperationBits       Indicates what operation is to be performed on the specified DOM table entry.
'                                      The following values are used:
'
'                                      DOMOperations.DOMInsert (0)
'                                      DOMOperations.DOMUpdate (1)
'                                      DOMOperations.DOMDelete (2)
'
'      Bit 7       SideBits            Indicates which side of the DOM table this tick related to. The following
'                                      values are used:
'
'                                      DOMSides.DOMAsk (0)
'                                      DOMSides.DOMBid (1)
' </pre>
'
' <h3>Marketmaker field format</h3>
'
' The marketmaker field is stored in UTF-16 format. It may be encoded either little-endian or big-endian, and must be
' preceded with the appropriate byte order marker (BOM) as specified in RFC 2781 para 4.3.
